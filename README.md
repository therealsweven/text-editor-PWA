## Usage

The application may be installed as a PWA using the install button on the page or clicking the install icon on the right side of the browser address bar. The user will edit text in the editor and upon clicking anywhere outside of the editor box, the text will be saved to either an indexedDB database or in local storage so that the next time the user visits the text editor their text will still be there. This app is also designed in a way that it is fully functional even when not connected to the internet.
